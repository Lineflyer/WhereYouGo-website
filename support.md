# Support

We usually get quite a lot of support mails dealing with various topics. This can be either mails about problems you have with WhereYouGo or ideas for new features, functionalities or general improvement proposals.

As we are only a small team answering a lot of mails is very time consuming, so we want to give you an overview about how to help yourself before contacting us.

We divided this information into "Help for problems" and "Ideas for WhereYouGo":

## You have a problem using WhereYouGo?

### Before sending us a mail regarding a problem...

We kindly ask you to make sure your problem is not covered by the following information before sending us a mail:

- First of all please check if your problem is answered in our [FAQ](./faq)!

- You should also check if your problem is already listed on our [Bugtracking system](https://github.com/cgeo/WhereYouGo/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc). In this case we are already working on it and you can follow the status of the problem there.

- Finally please check out our [social network presence](#action-follow) (and follow us there) to get the latest information about recent problems or service interruptions.

### Ask our support team about your problem

Our team members speak English and German.
Please try to write your mail in one of these languages to make it easier for us to reply to you.

We are always trying to answer all of your mails, but sometimes we receive a high amount of requests thus our team might need some time to answer.

Please include the following items in your mail:

1. Information about your device (Manufacturer, Android version)
2. A step-by-step procedure which lead to the problem (if applicable)
3. Information about error messages shown by WhereYouGo (if applicable)
4. Also include all additional info which might be useful for us to reproduce the problem (e.g. screenshots, cartridge files, GC-codes, etc.)

Send your email to [whereyougo@cgeo.org](mailto:whereyougo@cgeo.org?subject=Support needed for WhereYouGo&body=Please include a detailed problem description as advised on our support page!)

## You have an idea for improvements or new features?

### Before sending us a mail regarding a new feature...

There are already a lot of ideas for possible new features and functionalities of WhereYouGo. However we are only a small team of developers with limited resources, who are maintaining c:geo in their free time and it is already a lot of work to maintain c:geo and solve bugs.

So it is impossible for us to implement those wishes by ourselves on short term.
But WhereYouGo is open source, so anyone willing and able to help us is welcome to do so.

We are also using our bugtracking system for documentation of new ideas and feature requests. Before contacting us with your idea please check if it is not already contained in our list of [Feature Requests](https://github.com/cgeo/WhereYouGo/issues?q=label%3A%22Feature+Request%22+sort%3Acreated-desc).

Our [FAQ](./faq) might also contain some answers about why certain features or functions are currently not implemented.
